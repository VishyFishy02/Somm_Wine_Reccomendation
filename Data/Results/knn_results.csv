| Lockwood 2011 Liquid Velvet Red (California)  | As the name implies, this is a soft wine, with gentle tannins and acids. It's ripe in cherry and blackberry jam flavors that finish simple and sweet.                                                                                                           | Red Blend                | US        | California    | Lockwood       | California |
| Tenuta Monteti 2006 Monteti Red (Toscana)     | This thick, juicy, inky wine (with a large component of Petit Verdot) would pair with aged cheese or pecorino. The wine is still young (let it age five more years) with firm, sticky tannins and loads of blackberry and plum cake on the long finish.         | Red Blend                | Italy     | Toscana       | Tenuta Monteti | Tuscany    |
| Avant 2013 Rich Silky Smooth Red (California) | Rich flavors and a juicy texture make this dark-colored but medium-bodied wine fun to drink. It smells like ripe boysenberries, tastes almost jammy, and has a nice grip on the palate. It comes with a very reasonable price tag for the quality.              | Red Blend                | US        | California    | Avant          | California |
| Vellum 2009 Black Red (Napa Valley)           | This Petit Verdot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend clearly wants some time in the cellar. Although it's extraordinarily rich with blackberries, black currants and violets, the tannin-acid structure is such that aging for at least ten years shouldn't be a problem. | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Napa Valley   | Vellum         | California |
| Vellum 2013 Black Red (Suisun Valley)         | This big, imposing wine offers a deep red color, huge structure of grippy tannins and full body. It has giant berry flavors, all in an attractive dry style, but one that needs time to smooth out. It's best to drink after 2018.                              | Red Blend                | US        | Suisun Valley | Vellum         | California |"

Off dry in style, it's juicy in sweet white-grapefruit flavor accented by zesty acidity and a polished, mineral warmth on the finish.                                                                                                                                                | Riesling  | Germany   | Rheinhessen | Schmitt Söhne        | Rheinhessen |

| Schloss Vollrads 2010 Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau)               | Whiffs of orange blossoms add delicate floral flair to sweet marmalade and honey tones on this penetrating dessert Riesling. While creamy and sweet on the tongue, earthy mineral tones and piercing acidity add balance and structure. It's delicious now, but certainly an age-worthy wine that will develop gorgeously over the next two decades at least. | Riesling  | Germany   | Rheingau    | Schloss Vollrads     | Rheingau    |
| Villa Wolf 2014 Dry Riesling (Pfalz)                                  | On first whiff, there's a savoriness to this nutty, slightly smoky wine.

| Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel) | Sweet, verging on honeyed, this lush wine features plenty of superripe apples balanced by just a dash of citrus and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Could use more complexity.                                                                                                                                                                            | Riesling  | Germany   | Mosel       | Dr. Pauly Bergweiler | Mosel       |"

| Bock 2000 Cuvée Barrique Red (Villány)                | The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless. | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | Hungary   | Villány     | Bock                     | Villány        |

It's rich in dry, furry tannins. Needs something big and meaty to soften it, like beef stew.                                                                               | Red Blend                | US           | California           | Stephen Vincent | California |

This is huge in the mouth, with blackberry and wild herb flavors. A finish of chocolate, fig and prune is rich but right for the gig.

The color is deeply golden and saturated and aromas include toasted almond, dried yellow rose, candied fruit and apricot.

| The Boneyard 2012 An Unrefined Red Wine Red (Virginia)            | Red fruit notes of currant and cherry are bright, with a slightly spicy undertone and zesty acidity. This light-bodied blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvèdre, Dornfleder and Cabernet Franc is accessible and easy, with mild tannins providing just enough structure to hold it together. | Red Blend                | US        | Virginia      | The Boneyard        | Virginia   |
| Peter Franus 2006 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)                      | Quite a good wine, with Cabernet-esque blackberries and black currants, and a rich toastiness from charred oak. Feels a little angular and jammy in youth. Give it two or three years in the cellar to soften and mellow.                                                                   | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Napa Valley   | Peter Franus        | California |

| Tarara 2008 Charval White Table Wine White (Virginia)       | Apples and pears dominate the nose and palate of this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris. Full bodied and fermented in stainless steel, this slightly off-dry wine is rich in texture, but stays fresh with a vibrant lemon-lime acidity. | White Blend | US        | Virginia          | Tarara                | Virginia         |
| Antonio Cesar Cavalli 2007 White Pearl Chardonnay (Mendoza) | Waxy aromas of scented candles and canned pears define the nose. The palate is low on acid and thus tastes soft and remotely of Bartlett pear and peach. Light on the finish; thus it needs to be drunk now.                                               | Chardonnay  | Argentina | Mendoza           | Antonio Cesar Cavalli | Mendoza Province |
| Palaia Vineyards NV Pearl White (New York)                  | Hints of popcorn and buttered toast accent flavors of pressed apple and pear on this easygoing semisweet Cayuga. It's delicate in frame, finishing with a bright burst of lemon-candy acidity.                                                             | White Blend | US        | New York          | Palaia Vineyards      | New York         |
| EOS 2014 Reserve White (Santa Ynez Valley)                  | Faint aromas of Anjou pear and Gala apple are shy to rise off this bottling. Baked apple and pear notes also come through on the palate, with a hint of honey and a noticeably grippy texture.                                                             | White Blend | US        | Santa Ynez Valley | EOS                   | California       |
| Antonio Cesar Cavalli 2008 White Pearl Chardonnay (Mendoza) | Hints of wisteria and lemon blossom give this dilute Chardonnay a respectable bouquet, while the palate is mild and tastes like bites of lemon, apple and orange. There's not much weight or stuffing to it, but it's generally clean and inoffensive.     | Chardonnay  | Argentina | Mendoza           | Antonio Cesar Cavalli | Mendoza Province |"

| Grant Burge 2000 Barossa Vines Shiraz (Barossa Valley)             | Packed with grapey, plummy fruit, smoke and vanilla, this is solid entry-level stuff. It's not particularly rich or concentrated, but it is something that's uncommon at this price: balanced. That makes it an attractive by-the-glass option or barbecue companion. —J.C.                                                                                    | Shiraz             | Australia | Barossa Valley | Grant Burge               | South Australia |
| Hamilton's Ewell Vineyard 2000 Railway Chardonnay (Barossa Valley) | The warm climate of the Barossa is reflected in the heavy, sweet fruit flavors.

| Thorn Clarke 2013 Terra Barossa Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)       | A terrific value if you can find it (alas, only 150 cases were imported), this is full bodied and richly textured, marrying hints of peppery spice with grilled lavender and rosemary that perfectly season the beach cherry and mocha flavors. It's stout, tannic and mouth coating on the finish, ideal for matching with roasts or steaks.

| Château Tanunda 2012 Grand Barossa Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)    | This is a well-priced example of Barossa Cabernet, laden with characteristic notes of chocolate, mint and berry fruit, wrapped in a layer of toasty oak. It's full bodied, yet easy to drink because of the soft tannins and mouthwatering finish. Probably best between now and 2020.                                                                         | Cabernet Sauvignon | Australia | Barossa        | Château Tanunda           | South Australia |

| Cave Extrême NV Cuvée Speciale Sparkling (Mendoza)                             | Quite neutral and distant on the nose, with dry apple flavors working the soft, balanced palate. There are complexities such as white pepper and nutty nuances, but in the end it's an average sparkler with a controlled approach. Good for Argentina but probably not ready to compete with the world's best $20 sparkling wines. | Sparkling Blend | Argentina | Mendoza             | Cave Extrême      | Mendoza Province |
| Yorkville Cellars 2011 Estate Grown Cuvee Brut Sparkling (Yorkville Highlands) | This is refreshing and quite dry, with fragrant fruit cocktail aromas and subtle, spare flavors that suggest it would be a great oyster wine. Made from 51% Sémillon along with other grapes it's interesting enough to serve during dinner as well as an apéritif.                                                                 | Sparkling Blend | US        | Yorkville Highlands | Yorkville Cellars | California       |

The vibrant palate delivers Bartlett pear, mature apple, lemon zest and toasted almond alongside a soft perlage.                                                                       | Chardonnay      | Italy     | Franciacorta        | Lo Sparviere      | Lombardy         |

Cedar and myrrh flavors lead the woody palate, where a buoyant acidity lifts up the red cherry and tart red-currant fruits. | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Paso Robles          | Caldera             | California   |

An earthy quality shades modest cherry flavors, while hints of clove and cinnamon add complexity.                                                                                                      | Pinot Noir               | US        | Anderson Valley      | Toulouse            | California   |

| Raymond 2012 Small Lot Collection Barrel-Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley) | Way too oaky, with buttered toast, honey and caramel flavors dominating. The underlying wine, which is crisp in acidity and suggests limes, peaches and apricots, just isn't strong enough to handle all that oak.                                                                          | Chardonnay | US        | Napa Valley          | Raymond                      | California |

| Woodinville Wine Cellars 2004 O.M.O. Red (Columbia Valley (WA))             | Plenty of deep color, thick tannin and dark streaks of smoke and tar make this a stand-up steakhouse wine.

| Murrieta's Well 2014 The Spur Red (Livermore Valley)  | This wine is deeply colored, quite oaky in aroma, bold in terms of fruit flavors and has a lively texture due to good acidity and moderate tannins. The fruit has a bright quality like red cherries and cranberries and the oaky spices wind through the finish.                                                                                                                       | Red Blend | US        | Livermore Valley | Murrieta's Well   | California |
| Murrieta's Well 2013 The Spur Red (Livermore Valley)  | An attractive, oaky perfume and melt-in-the-mouth fruit and dark-chocolate flavors make this full-bodied wine hard to resist.

| Pinord 2010 +7 Red (Priorat)                          | This ripe, healthy wine offers aromas of baked black fruits, licorice and raisin. In the mouth, it's more vital than on the nose; racy acidity and firm but pure tannins make sure of that. For flavors, look for savory tomato, plum, berry fruits, licorice and schisty minerality. Finishing notes of mocha, plum and coffee are braced by hard-driving tannins. Drink through 2024. | Red Blend | Spain     | Priorat          | Pinord            | Catalonia  |
| Spicy Vines 2014 Barbarian Barbera (Sierra Foothills) | Wonderfully smooth and layered, this medium-bodied wine smells like fresh berries, tastes fruity and mildly spicy and feels silky in the mouth. The components are beautifully balanced, as fresh acidity lifts the fruitiness and mild tannins add a velvety touch.                                                                                                                    | Barbera   | US        | Sierra Foothills | Spicy Vines       | California |

| Honor Winery 2012 Highest Honor Red (Napa Valley)                 | This big-bottled, wax-topped wine blends half Merlot with a quarter each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Thick and concentrated in red fruit, it holds back on body somewhat, making way for a soft, likable character with a touch of grit among the definitive red cherry.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Red Blend          | US        | Napa Valley      | Honor Winery      | California |
| Luko 2005 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)        | Expensive, but worth it. Absolutely a first-rate dry red wine of great substance and authority. Shows full-bodied blackberry flavors with a meaty, leathery edge and hints of violets, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. Such is the tannic structure that the wine should develop through 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Syrah              | US        | Santa Barbara    | Luko              | California |
| Wise Villa 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Foothills)      | Bright, crisp red cherry and blackberry flavors drive a refreshing, fruity personality. Touches of nutmeg and vanilla show through, but this is not an oaky wine by any means. It will please a crowd and pair well with a wide variety of foods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Cabernet Sauvignon | US        | Sierra Foothills | Wise Villa        | California |
| Tres Vinicultores 2007 The Treat Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley) | The winery says it can't reveal the source of the grapes, which is odd, but we do know it's in Rutherford. Made from 100% Cab, and aged in 100% new French oak, it is, in a word, splendid. Rich in blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, the fruit was clearly well grown, and the tannin-acid balance is utterly classic. This beautiful wine is a partnership between three well-known and high-scoring vintners from other brands. It is a winery worth following. | Cabernet Sauvignon | US        | Napa Valley      | Tres Vinicultores | California |
| Worthy 2008 Sophia's Cuvee Red (Napa Valley)                      | This has Cabernet Sauvignon-driven flavors of ripe summer blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak. It's dry with smooth tannins, and it shows lots of class. With 8,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Red Blend          | US        | Napa Valley      | Worthy            | California |"

Even so, it is a gentle red wine that is ready to drink.                                                                                                                                                 | Malbec                   | France    | Cahors                 | Jean-Luc Baldès | Southwest France |
| Stephanie 2005 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)            | This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate. Shows lush cherries and cassis, with rich nuances of vanilla, smoky wood and anise. Decadent and delicious, and best now through 2011. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties. | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Napa Valley            | Stephanie       | California       |
| Rezonja 2005 Eleganten Red (Alexander Valley)        | This Cab-based Bordeaux blend is harsh and tannic, with baked berry and currant flavors.

| Willamette Valley Vineyards 2008 Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley) | Dry indeed; this is so dry as to be outright sour. It's an acid-lover's dream wine; but be prepared to pucker up. It's a mouthful of lemon juice, some cardboardy phenolics, and very tart green apples.                                                                                  | Riesling        | US        | Willamette Valley    | Willamette Valley Vineyards | Oregon      |

So easy to like, and the alcohol is relatively low. | Riesling        | US        | Napa Valley          | V. Sattui                   | California  |"

Acceptable but that's it.                                                                                                                     | Sauvignon Blanc    | Argentina | Mendoza Province | Valentin Bianchi  | Mendoza Province |
| Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Cabernet Sauvignon (Calchaquí Valley)   | A fleshy wine with aromas of wet clay and earth. It seems a little hot and herbal at its foundation, but around the edges there are flavors of cherry and raspberry. The feel is chunky and innocuous, with mild tannins.                                                                                   | Cabernet Sauvignon | Argentina | Calchaquí Valley | Michel Torino     | Other            |
| Argie 2009 Andes Torrontés (La Rioja)                                | Seems like we're catching this wine late in its cycle. It's not very expressive on the nose, and even though there's still life to the palate, it's dealing only mild apple and citrus flavors followed by heat and acidic scour on the finish.                                                             | Torrontés          | Argentina | La Rioja         | Argie             | Other            |
| Familia Schroeder 2007 Saurus Patagonia Cabernet Sauvignon (Neuquén) | Opens with red fruit aromas that are like a million other generic red wines, while the body has size, grab and stickiness. Flavors of cola, cherry, cassis and plum are red in nature and basically good, while the finish is candied but not overly so. An everyman's Cabernet in every sense of the word. | Cabernet Sauvignon | Argentina | Neuquén          | Familia Schroeder | Other            |"

| Barker's Marque 2015 Arona Certified Sustainable Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough) | Certified Sustainable applies to almost all New Zealand wines these days, so it's a bit of a gimmick to place it so prominently on the label, but what's in the bottle is very good. It's got those “good green” notes of snow pea, a hint of struck flint and tart pineapple flavors that linger on the finish. It's only light in body, but concentrated in flavor. | Sauvignon Blanc | New Zealand  | Marlborough             | Barker's Marque | Marlborough     |
| Green Path 2006 Organic Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)                       | Sold in 1-liter Tetra Prisma packaging meant to reduce greenhouse emissions, this is an ecofriendly wine that tastes good. Its bouquet is its strongest asset, offering floral, perfumy notes of white pepper and rhubarb, while the palate is on the light side for Shiraz, but clean and supple. Drink now.                                                         | Shiraz          | Australia    | South Eastern Australia | Green Path      | Australia Other |
| Parducci 2006 Sustainable White Red (Mendocino County)                         | A brisk, brusque, tannic wine whose rusticity calls for easy fare, like backyard barbecue or even fast-food burgers. It's dry and full-bodied, a country-style blend with deep flavors of blackberries and tobacco. The price is fair.                                                                                                                                | Red Blend       | US           | Mendocino               | Parducci        | California      |

Unfortunately it's heavy on the grape-juice characteristic, with sharp acids running the show. Dense and chewy, and there's an odd grapefruit note at the end.                                                                                                          | Pinot Noir      | US           | Oregon Other            | Amity           | Oregon          |
| Makulu NV Sustainable Agriculture Perlè Moscato (Western Cape)                 | A spritzy and effervescent selection, the carbonation helps to lift the inherent sweet fruit aromas and flavors of guava, peach and mushy pear. An ideal choice for a warm summer day by the pool, served very cold.                                                                                                                                                  | Moscato         | South Africa | Western Cape            | Makulu          | Western Cape    |"

| O'Vineyards 2006 Proprietor's Reserve Red (Cabardes)                     | Loads of menthol and pepper spice fill the nose, with a supporting fruit core of black cherry, black currant and wild raspberry. The texture is like crushed satin but the tannins, though fine grain, have good staying power.

| Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Grand Muscat (Rutherglen)                 | Deep mahogany. Dried fig and black tea on the nose, then concentrated mocha and molasses flavors, enlivened by candied orange zest. Full, rich and sweet, but surprisingly drinkable, with terrific intensity and length. Coffee-colored, with enticing scents of orange drizzled with dark maple syrup, coffee and raisins. Sweet, upfront and lushly textured, this is an easy-to-appreciate Muscat with great length. Not as darkly concentrated or marked by rancio as the Rare bottling (but considerably less expensive), this is still an excellent sweet wine. Earthy notes of caramel and mocha dominate, rounded out by candied dates and wrapped up by a long, coffee-tinged finish. | Muscat             | Australia    | Rutherglen     | Chambers Rosewood Vineyards | Victoria             |

| Veramar NV Riesling-Vidal Blanc White (Virginia)   | Bruised apple and high-toned apple cider notes on the nose. It's an appley wine with familiar hints of ginger and apple pie spice, but brisk acidity and a supple mouthfeel keeps it from being overtly homespun in style. On the nose, this wine offers muted banana, lychee and pineapple. Flavors are tropical and overripe, coating the mouth with plump papaya, passion fruit and guava. It's a little heavy, needing a bit more acidic lift. | White Blend  | US        | Virginia    | Veramar      | Virginia           |

| Pinord 2010 +7 Red (Priorat)                        | This ripe, healthy wine offers aromas of baked black fruits, licorice and raisin. In the mouth, it's more vital than on the nose; racy acidity and firm but pure tannins make sure of that. For flavors, look for savory tomato, plum, berry fruits, licorice and schisty minerality. Finishing notes of mocha, plum and coffee are braced by hard-driving tannins. Drink through 2024. | Red Blend                | Spain     | Priorat       | Pinord         | Catalonia  |

| Taken Wine Co. 2013 Complicated Red (Central Coast) | Black cherries, cola, fennel and dill come together for a thick aromatic profile on this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignane.

Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.                         | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | Hungary   | Villány       | Bock           | Villány    |

Probably not an ager, so drink with a nice grilled pork chop.                                                                    | Red Blend                | US        | Mendocino     | Paul Dolan     | California |"

| Koenig Vineyards 2010 Ice Wine Riesling                                       | All from Windrige Vineyard, this is an aromatic, appealing dessert-style wine with notes of dried pink grapefruit and honey. At 18.6% residual sugar, it's rich and concentrated, with good depth and intensity.                                                                                                                                                                  | Riesling       | US        | Idaho           | Koenig Vineyards | Idaho      |
| Viento 2009 Pine Grove Vineyard Vintage Select Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR)) | This is declassified ice wine, picked frozen. It does not have the depth of the other dessert wines from Viento, but it is a remarkable effort, textural and delicate, with threads of straw, honey, cracker, candied tropical fruits and more, but all in a light and delicate style. This could easily become a wine that will amaze people in a blind tasting given the price. | Riesling       | US        | Oregon Other    | Viento           | Oregon     |
| Styring 2013 Afterglow Estate Dessert Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)                 | This is an absolutely stunning wine, thick and dense with an array of candied fruits, caramel, marmalade, butterscotch and more.

| Greenwood Ridge 2008 Estate bottled White Riesling (Mendocino Ridge)          | You have to classify this as a dry table wine, but it has enough residual sugar to qualify in the dessert category. With high, crisply clean acidity, it shows sugar-infused pineapple, pear, green apple and honeysuckle flavors.                                                                                                                                                | White Riesling | US        | Mendocino Ridge | Greenwood Ridge  | California |

| Allora 1999 Tresca Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)           | Here's a good example of what's so disturbing about the rash of expensive Cabernets and blends that has possessed the minds of consumers. This is an awkward, cumbersome wine. Sure, the fruit is as ripe as anything on earth, but what good is extract if it doesn't have balance? The wine is excessively soft. It's cloying, and to add insult to injury, it's tannic. There are wines that cost one-fifth the price that are far better. | Cabernet Sauvignon | US        | Napa Valley    | Allora              | California   |

Its thick blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit carries even darker streaks of chocolate and espresso. Though still rare, Tannat is making a home for itself in Southern Oregon. It's a meaty, steak-friendly alternative to pricier Cabernets.                                                                                                                                       | Tannat             | US        | Oregon Other   | Abacela             | Oregon       |

| Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2004 Escudo Rojo Red (Maipo Valley) | Early aromas are earthy, sort of like coffee grinds mixed with baked fruit. The palate hits with a dose of creamy milk chocolate, while later on berries and vanilla rise up. More of a plump, sweet and unctuous wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Syrah and Cabernet Franc.

Perfect for a rib roast meal with buttery mashed potatoes, let it breathe a half-hour or two before serving.                                            | Petite Sirah       | US        | South Coast          | Orfila      | California |

| Martin & Weyrich 2006 Moscato Allegro Muscat Canelli (Paso Robles) | The sweetness from the 10.5% residual sugar is the main thing this has going for it.

Well-made it is balanced and age-worthy, the proper pour for a slab of grilled meat slathered in spicy sauce. | Red Blend                | US        | Lodi                 | Borra                    | California |

The finish lingers.                                                                                                                     | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Columbia Valley (WA) | JM Cellars            | Washington |

| Domaine Jean Fournier 2014 Les Longeroies  (Marsannay)     | This balanced wine is full of dusty, dry tannins as well as ripe red fruits. A smokiness gives a dense, toasty character to the wine. With good acidity, typical of the vintage, the wine is well placed to develop. Drink from 2020.                                                                                            | Pinot Noir               | France    | Marsannay            | Domaine Jean Fournier | Burgundy   |"

| Willamette Valley Vineyards 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)          | The Estate bottling, at least at the moment, is a light and delicate wine, with more than a hint of beetroot and stem. The cherry fruit is pleasant and a bit thin, but the wine has some complexity, which shows in the residual flavors of orange peel.                                 | Pinot Noir         | US        | Willamette Valley | Willamette Valley Vineyards | Oregon     |

| Willamette Valley Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley) | The Estate Vineyard bottling shows a definite meaty, almost Rhone-like aroma, but this is no Syrah. It's a very elegant, light, sultry bottle of Pinot Noir. The tart black cherry and currant fruit is shadowed by smoke and cinnamon, but the balance throughout is light and delicate. | Pinot Noir         | US        | Willamette Valley | Willamette Valley Vineyards | Oregon     |

| Locati Cellars 2009 Innovation Red (Columbia Valley (WA))       | Innovation is a blend of 50% Sangiovese, and one-quarter each Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. Though the blend is interesting, it remains generic, with dilute flavors of cranberry and strawberry. The earthy tannins wrap up a quick finish.                                                                                                                                                                         | Red Blend                | US        | Columbia Valley (WA) | Locati Cellars | Washington |
| Pircas Negras 2007 Organic Cabernet Sauvignon (Famatina Valley) | An interesting wine that walks to the beat of its own drum. Organic wines are almost always a little unusual, and this is no different. It pours on the funky red-fruit aromas and then come herbal cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. As a whole it's a good, well-made wine with decent feel. But hailing from La Rioja, it also has its own unfamiliar identity. Worth a try if organic wines are your thing.                           | Cabernet Sauvignon       | Argentina | Famatina Valley      | Pircas Negras  | Other      |

The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind. | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Napa Valley          | Portfolio      | California |

| Lindemans 2001 Bin 50 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)          | Grapey and sappy, with almost candied cherry fruit, this is a young wine made to be consumed young. Try chilling it to give the cherry and chocolate flavors greater focus and quaff it with burgers this summer. —J.C.                                                                           | Shiraz          | Australia | South Eastern Australia | Lindemans     | Australia Other |
| Angove's 2006 Nine Vines Shiraz-Viognier (South Australia)      | This wine shows strong barnyard and sulfur notes overwhelming an otherwise appealing nose of herbes de Provence and grilled pork.

| Petaluma 1999 Bridgewater Mill Shiraz (Australia)               | Unlike many an Australian Shiraz, this one sees only French oak barrels for aging. The result is a dense, blueberry-filled wine, supported by hints of toast and espresso. It's full-bodied but not tiring to drink, thanks to an enlivening burst of black pepper on the finish.

It's an appley wine with familiar hints of ginger and apple pie spice, but brisk acidity and a supple mouthfeel keeps it from being overtly homespun in style. On the nose, this wine offers muted banana, lychee and pineapple. Flavors are tropical and overripe, coating the mouth with plump papaya, passion fruit and guava. It's a little heavy, needing a bit more acidic lift. | White Blend      | US        | Virginia         | Veramar         | Virginia    |

Deft use of new French oak results in a full-bodied wine with a lush, buttered toast richness that highlights sweet apple and lemon flavors. The finish is clean and lemony with a slight saline touch.                                      | Chardonnay         | US        | Virginia    | Barrel Oak     | Virginia   |
| 1000 Stories 2013 Bourbon Barrel Aged Zinfandel (Mendocino)                                        | This approachable wine from the Fetzer organization was aged in Bourbon barrels. It has good balance, wonderful fruit flavors, a polished texture and lingering finish. Dark in color, the aromas suggest ripe berries and cherries, and the flavors flow similarly rich and deep.                                                  | Zinfandel          | US        | Mendocino   | 1000 Stories   | California |
| Robert Mondavi 2014 Private Selection Aged in Bourbon Barrels Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey County) | This wine gets a bonus for venturing into new territory, aging Cab in used Bourbon barrels. The result is far from perfect, but not as gimmicky as one might assume. Aromas of leathery blackberry, cedar, roasted pasilla chile and tons of caramel lead into flavors of cocoa, coconut and caramel on the creamy, peppery palate. | Cabernet Sauvignon | US        | Monterey    | Robert Mondavi | California |
| Woodbridge 2001 Barrel Aged Chardonnay (California)                                                | Like a photocopy of a good Chardonnay, this wine is indistinct. There are some decent peach and apple flavors and what tastes like a dose of oak, but it's really thin and watery.                                                                                                                                                  | Chardonnay         | US        | California  | Woodbridge     | California |
| Flora Springs 2013 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley)                                       | There's no bones about the use of oak in this wine, which spent nine months enjoying the cradling effects of a good barrel, the majority French and 25% American. Ample fragrances of lemon and lime infuse the well-balanced wine that is also marked by crisp minerality, cinnamon toast and pear.                                | Chardonnay         | US        | Napa Valley | Flora Springs  | California |"

| Bergström 2013 Winery Block Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)              | This is identified as the smallest estate vineyard, here delivering a light and pretty wine, perfectly proportioned in a small frame. Strawberry and raspberry fruit shows clean, crisp acidity. There is room for further bottle development; at the moment the wine does a quick, gentle fade.                           | Pinot Noir         | US        | Chehalem Mountains   | Bergström       | Oregon     |
| Kathryn Kennedy 2014 Small Lot Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains) | The nose on this bottling from the pioneering regional winery, now run by its namesake's son, is lush and dynamic, with black cherry, cola and vanilla-laced pie crust on the nose. Finely polished tannins carry very smooth flavors of blackberry, soy-driven umami, crushed graphite, light cedar and a pinch of herbs. | Cabernet Sauvignon | US        | Santa Cruz Mountains | Kathryn Kennedy | California |"

| Vilafonté 2014 Series C Red (Paarl)            | At present, the wood dominates the nose and mouth of this lush, creamy wine. It's brimming with notes of cedar, sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa powder that ride atop the baked cherry and raspberry fruit. The mouthfeel is smooth and plush, with velvety tannins and lingering dry, spicy notes that grace the finish. An infant now, give it some time to further harmonize and the oak to integrate; try after 2019. | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | South Africa | Paarl         | Vilafonté    | Paarl      |

Pear, lime and lemongrass dot the landscape of complex flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Chardonnay               | US        | Dry Creek Valley     | Once and It's Gone | California |
| Portfolio 2013 Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley)                      | Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind. | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Napa Valley          | Portfolio          | California |
| Joseph Cellars 2014 Limited Edition Pinot Noir (Carneros)             | This is an earthy wine with a persistent thread of acidity that keeps it fresh and vibrant in the glass. Bursting with red cherry and pomegranate fruit, it has rich complements of compost and black licorice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Pinot Noir               | US        | Carneros             | Joseph Cellars     | California |
| Publix 2010 Premium Limited Edition Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley) | This wine is savory in style, with flavors of raspberries, orange peel and cola. Harsh in the mouth, with scoury acids and some abrupt tannins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Pinot Noir               | US        | Russian River Valley | Publix             | California |
| Chateau Auguste 2011 Limited Edition  (Bordeaux Supérieur)            | This is an aromatic wine with mint and eucalyptus aromas that linger on the palate. It's firm, strongly wood aged, and has striking acidity. It needs time to integrate and age, so drink from 2016.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | France    | Bordeaux Supérieur   | Chateau Auguste    | Bordeaux   |"
Can you suggest a red wine that's bold but not overly tannic?,"| title                                               | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | variety                  | country   | region         | winery       | province       |

| Fetzer NV Anthony's Hill Dark Bold Red (California) | Not quite as bold as its name suggests, this wine is well-balanced and fun to sip. Fruity and medium-bodied, it smells like raspberries and rhubarb, tastes like red cherries and feels nicely full on the palate, bolstered by a hearty dose of fine tannins.                                                                                                 | Red Blend                | US        | California     | Fetzer       | California     |
| Bonterra 2013 The Butler Red (Mendocino)            | Big, tight and tannic, this is a full-fledged dinner wine that needs to pair with a nice caloric veal shank or lasagna. It's made with 80% Syrah, so the color is almost black, the aromas are spicy and smoky and the flavors feature black cherry, espresso and dark chocolate. The texture is both mouth filling and a bit astringent due to hefty tannins. | Rhône-style Red Blend    | US        | Mendocino      | Bonterra     | California     |
| Di Meo 2004 Riserva  (Taurasi)                      | You can't go wrong with a beautifully bold and structured red wine like this. Meant for cold winter nights and hearty meat dishes, this elegant Taurasi opens with luscious dark fruit, prune, spice and tobacco notes. The wine's texture is fine and silky, with polished, dusty tannins.                                                                    | Aglianico                | Italy     | Taurasi        | Di Meo       | Southern Italy |
| Viña Collado 1999 Tinto Red (Campo de Borja)        | A clean, light wine with cherry and cinnamon notes on the nose and in the mouth. This isn't heavy or deep, but tasty, and evenly textured. Elegant herb and mineral shadings show on the close of this attractive easy drinker. Would do well with a very light chill. —M.M.                                                                                   | Tempranillo Blend        | Spain     | Campo de Borja | Viña Collado | Northern Spain |
| Hendry 2005 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)              | Crisp acidity and firm tannins give a framework to this massively fruity, rather extracted blend of all five Bordeaux varieties. Without that structure, it would be all jammy cherries and currants. Fine now with a grilled steak, and for the next several years.                                                                                           | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | US        | Napa Valley    | Hendry       | California     |"
