It is going to need some time to lose that spicy flavor that currently dominates the wine. Give it until 2021. Although the oak imprints strong flavors in this wine, it's still young, so all the spice and toastiness will integrate. The fruit is there, showing a rich medley of apples, pears and citrus.
