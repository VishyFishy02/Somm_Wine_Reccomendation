But this is part of a new wave of Aussie Shiraz—medium in body and silky in style, with moderate alcohol levels.

| Peter Lehmann 2014 Portrait Shiraz (Barossa Valley) | This medium-bodied Shiraz represents a solid value.

| St Hallett 2008 Gamekeeper's Shiraz (Barossa)       | Full bodied and supple, this nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz shows that value still exists even in big-name regions of Australia. Intense blueberry and spice aromas give way to mixed berries and vanilla on the palate, and if it's not overly complex, it's a still a concentrated mouthful of Shiraz at a bargain price. | Shiraz    | Australia | Barossa        | St Hallett       | South Australia |
| Glaetzer 2013 Bishop Shiraz (Barossa Valley)        | This has gone up in price over the years, but it's still a solid, relatively affordable example of Barossa Valley Shiraz.

| Thomas George 2007 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)          | The vineyard is great and famous, yet the wine doesn't exhibit its best qualities. It's soft and rather direct, with flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange rind and cola, accented with sweet smoky oak. Good and silky, but could come from anywhere.                                                              | Pinot Noir | US        | Russian River Valley | Thomas George     | California |

The firm palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, chopped sage and licorice alongside rather austere, close-grained tannins.                  | Red Blend | Italy     | Ghemme               | Ioppa           | Piedmont   |

| Willamette Valley Vineyards 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)          | The Estate bottling, at least at the moment, is a light and delicate wine, with more than a hint of beetroot and stem. The cherry fruit is pleasant and a bit thin, but the wine has some complexity, which shows in the residual flavors of orange peel.                                                                        | Pinot Noir | US        | Willamette Valley  | Willamette Valley Vineyards | Oregon     |
| Lenné Estate 2014 Estate Pinot Noir                                             | This barrel selection is difficult to spot, because the word “estate” is just very lightly imprinted under the name Lenné. It's clearly a bigger juicier more tannic wine than its excellent sibling, with deep flavors of raspberry fruit, highlights of white pepper, and acids that push the flavors down through the palate. | Pinot Noir | US        | Willamette Valley  | Lenné Estate                | Oregon     |
| Willamette Valley Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley) | The Estate Vineyard bottling shows a definite meaty, almost Rhone-like aroma, but this is no Syrah. It's a very elegant, light, sultry bottle of Pinot Noir. The tart black cherry and currant fruit is shadowed by smoke and cinnamon, but the balance throughout is light and delicate.                                        | Pinot Noir | US        | Willamette Valley  | Willamette Valley Vineyards | Oregon     |

There's much to admire, from the silky cherry fruit to the dusty traces of sandalwood, saffron and butter brickle.                                                  | Pinot Noir | US        | Chehalem Mountains | Roco                        | Oregon     |"

| Trabucco 2008 16 Marzo White (Falerno del Massico) | This is an herbal, floral white wine with aromas that span from dried hay to pungent lemon blossom. It seems to give the best of itself on the bouquet, because in the mouth, this wine is fresh, compact and very easygoing.                                         | White Blend | Italy     | Falerno del Massico | Trabucco | Southern Italy    |

| Cullen 2013 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River)           | It's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate. It's plump and slightly creamy in texture, but finishes with crisp, acidic verve. Drink now–2025.                                                                         | Chardonnay | Australia | Margaret River | Cullen      | Western Australia |
| Wise 2005 Eagle Bay Shiraz (Margaret River)                  | From Margaret River in Western Australia, this is a full-bodied, impressively endowed Shiraz at a reasonable price. Superripe aromas of blackberries and licorice mark the nose, while the palate features similar flavors, supple tanins and a creamy-textured finish. Good to go now, with enough concentration to hold until 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Shiraz     | Australia | Margaret River | Wise        | Western Australia |
| Maverick 2014 Breechens Shiraz (Barossa)                     | It's hard to believe such a wine can come from the Barossa, a region known for size and richness. But this is part of a new wave of Aussie Shiraz—medium in body and silky in style, with moderate alcohol levels. Healthy doses of oak impart notes of hickory smoke, cedar and vanilla to the plum fruit. Drink now–2025.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Shiraz     | Australia | Barossa        | Maverick    | South Australia   |

It's slightly dusty on the finish, making it food-friendly, ending with hints of cocoa and coffee.

| Shingleback NV Black Bubbles Sparkling Shiraz (McLaren Vale) | A sleek name and a sleek wine. Vanilla and toffee overflow from the effusive nose while sour candy and plum jam take over on the palate. It's a tad thin in the mouth but finishes on a lovely raspberry note that has just a bit of sticking power. Drink as the Australians do, with Christmas dinner. Sparkling Shiraz may not be something you pour every day, but this is one worth reaching for. It delivers lots of upfront berry fruit and lashings of dark chocolate, then finishes relatively dry and clean. | Shiraz     | Australia | McLaren Vale   | Shingleback | South Australia   |"
