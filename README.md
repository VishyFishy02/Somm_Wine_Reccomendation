# Somm_Wine_Reccomendation
Som·me·lier: a wine steward /ˌsəməlˈyā/

Our goal with this project is to build a wine recommendation engine to help users search for wines that fit their taste.

**Who does this project benefit?**

- Wine buyers:
    * [Wine is very confusing - huge variety + lack of consistent categorization](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/4/21152752/understanding-wine-complicated-learning-education)
    * Wine distribution is fragmented → not easy to find the same wine at another store → suggests a wine style

- Wine sellers: 
    * Use Somm as a recommender for an online store
    * Use Somm as a procurement tool that fit consumers’ demand

- Existing solutions:
    * Vivino: only let users search by wine name, grape type, price
    * Delectable: let users take a photo of a wine label and pull up reviews
    * Have not synthesize information for users
